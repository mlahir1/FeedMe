**Abstract:**

The main idea is develop an android app that helps to find the events where free food is available and also give the information of the various dishes available at food places at UMBC. The user of the app can post the the free food events on the campus using this application and the other users can give thumbs up to. The user can choose the free food events  based on the upvotes from the other users. We also have the webservice through which the vendors can add new food items to the database. 
The application is developed using Android Studio IDE and the backend services are hosted in  Amazon Web Services.

**Requirements:**
 
Android phone 

**Architecture:**

Service Oriented Architecture is employed while developing this application. Each component in the app is loosely coupled which makes the  maintenance of the app very easy. Following is the architecture of the project.
